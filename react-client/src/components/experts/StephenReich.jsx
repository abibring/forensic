        </p>
        <h3>Unbiased Evaluations, Reports, and Testimony</h3>
        <p>
          Dr. Reich has assisted the legal community with forensic psychological
          evaluations in countless criminal, immigration, employment, and civil
          cases. For three decades, he has provided unbiased psychodiagnostic
          evaluations, forensic reports, and courtroom testimony. As one of the
          few forensic psychologists in the United States who is also an
          experienced attorney, Dr. Reich brings rare wisdom and poise to the
          stand. His psychological insight and legal background are helpful in
          the preparation of a case, and have proved to be significant assets in
          the courtroom.
        </p>
        <h3>A Deep Interest in Psychological Assessment</h3>
        <p>
          Stephen Reich received his B.A., J.D. and M.B.A. from Columbia
          University. His M.B.A. specialization was in Industrial Relations, and
          he found that he was particularly interested in the psychological
          aspects of industrial relations. As an Assistant Attorney General for
          the State of New York, Stephen Reich was involved in numerous
          hearings, investigations and trials concerning violations of New York
          State security laws and syndication laws. He interviewed many
          potential defendants or material witnesses in connection with alleged
          crimes for which they were being investigated. He began to realize
          that his deeper interest was in the psychological aspects of the
          cases--what motivated the accused to act, how they acted, and the
          consequences that their actions had on their lives.
        </p>
        <h3>A Former Prosecutor and Defense Attorney</h3>
        <p>
          Stephen Reich is uniquely qualified in the area of criminal law and
          military courts martial, both as a lawyer and as a forensic
          psychologist. As a lawyer, he gained experience on both sides in
          criminal cases -- as a prosecutor and as a defense attorney. As an
          Assistant Attorney General of the State of New York, he prosecuted
          many white collar criminal cases. As a Lieutenant in the United States
          Naval Reserve, Judge Advocate General Corps, he defended Naval
          enlisted personnel during their military courts martial. Thus, he
          gained experience in criminal law in civilian courts and in military
          courts martial. His early career as a prosecutor and defense lawyer,
          and his subsequent training in psychology led him to the field of
          forensic psychology. During his training as a clinical psychologist,
          he studied with some of the nation's leading experts in the field of
          psychological assessment. As a forensic psychologist, Dr. Reich has
          served as an expert witness in numerous criminal cases, including
          military courts martial, in courtrooms and military bases around the
          nation.
        </p>
        <h3>Mentored by Leading Experts in Psychological Assessment</h3>
        <p>
          After practicing law for several years, Steve returned to graduate
          school to pursue his interest in psychology. He received a United
          States Public Health Fellowship in Clinical Psychology and earned his
          Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology at Fordham University. There, he was
          mentored by Dr. Marvin Reznikoff, one of the leading psychological and
          psychodiagnostic assessment experts in the United States, and studied
          under Dr. Anne Anastasi, one of the foremost authorities on
          psychological testing. He was awarded a Postdoctoral Fellowship in
          Clinical Psychology at Cornell University Medical College (now Weill
          Cornell Medical College) and continued to study psychological
          assessment under another nationally recognized expert, Dr. David
          Clayson, who headed the Division of Psychology at the Payne Whitney
          Psychiatric Clinic. Following his Fellowship, Dr. Reich was appointed
          to the faculty of Cornell University Medical College in the Department
          of Psychiatry, Division of Psychology. For three decades he was a
          faculty member of Weill Cornell Medical College and on the Attending
          Staff of the New York Presbyterian Hospital, Payne Whitney Psychiatric
          Clinic.
        </p>
        <h3>Specialization in Psychodiagnostic Evaluation</h3>
        <p>
          Early in his career, Dr. Steve Reich specialized in psychodiagnostic
          evaluation, psychological assessment, and psychotherapy. At Weill
          Cornell Medical College, he both lectured and supervised in all three
          areas. In his private practice as a psychologist, he specialized in
          individual and group therapy. The Consolidated Edison Company invited
          him to become a psychological consultant to the corporation. At Con
          Ed, Dr. Reich helped the company set up one of the earliest Employee
          Assistance Programs, in which any employee could receive psychological
          help in a completely confidential setting.
        </p>
        <h3>Active in Leading Professional Associations</h3>
        <p>
          Dr. Reich is a member of the American College of Forensic Psychology,
          the American Psychological Association, the New York State
          Psychological Association, the Association of the Bar of the City of
          New York, the New York State Bar Association, the National Employment
          Lawyers Association, the National Association of Criminal Defense
          Lawyers, the New York Criminal Defense Lawyers' Association, and the

        </p>
        <h3>A Team of Distinguished Forensic Psychologists</h3>
        <p>
          Dr. Reich's experiences as an expert witness in the courtroom made it
          clear to him that there was a great need for expert psychological
          services in many areas of law that was not being met. He saw what a
          dramatic difference that expert witness evaluations and expert
          testimony could make on both sides, and how they can strengthen the
          presentation of a case. He formed a group of clinical and forensic
          expert witnesses to fill this need. As Director of the Forensic
          Psychology Group, Dr. Reich leads a team of experts who are
          experienced in working collaboratively with attorneys in a wide range
          of forensic psychological issues.
