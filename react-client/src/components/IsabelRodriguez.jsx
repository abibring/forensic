          Clinical Neuropsychologist
        </h3>
        <h3>
          Specialized Training in Neuropsychology and Forensic Neuropsychology
        </h3>
        <p>
          Isabel A. Rodr&iacute;guez, Ph.D., a New York State licensed clinical
          psychologist, specializes in neuropsychological evaluations of English
          and Spanish-speaking adults, adolescents and children. Within the
          realm of forensic neuropsychology, Dr. Rodr&iacute;guez is experienced
          in working closely with attorneys and their clients to evaluate
          whether neurocognitive and psychological conditions and symptoms are
          related to injuries sustained in accidents or through negligence or
          medical malpractice. Completely bilingual (English-Spanish), she
          thoroughly evaluates records submitted by attorneys and performs
          neuropsychological and psychological evaluations to determine the
          correct diagnoses. The purpose of these evaluations is to determine
          whether there is a connection (nexus) between the injuries sustained
          and the neuropsychological and neurocognitive impairments that follow
          an injury, negligence or medical malpractice. A patient may present
          with impairments to executive functioning, impairments to verbal
          abilities, memory and learning difficulties, mood disorders, and
          social and emotional dysfunction.
        </p>
        <h3>Background and Education</h3>
        <p>
          Dr. Rodr&iacute;guez earned her Master of Arts (M.A.) and Doctor of
          Philosophy (Ph.D.) degrees in Clinical Psychology, with a
          specialization in Neuropsychology from Fordham University in New York
          City. At Fordham University, she was awarded a Presidential
          Scholarship from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. She earned
          her Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree in Psychology, Magna Cum Laude,
          from Florida International University in Miami.
        </p>
        <h3>Neuropsychological Training at NYU's Langone Medical Center</h3>
        <p>
          Dr. Rodr&iacute;guez received neuropsychological training at New York
          University (NYU) Langone Medical Center's Comprehensive Epilepsy
          Center, where she administered neuropsychological batteries in both
          English and Spanish and wrote neuropsychological reports for
          pre-surgical inpatient and non-surgical outpatient adults with
          treatment-refractory epilepsy. At NYU's Rusk Institute of
          Rehabilitation Medicine and the Stephen D. Hassenfeld Children's
          Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders she assessed pediatric and
          adolescent patients diagnosed with cancer, traumatic brain injury,
          neurodegenerative disorders, developmental disabilities, and learning
          disabilities. These evaluations were conducted for diagnostic
          purposes, educational placement, and associated treatment planning
          including recommendation of related services for NYC Department of
          Education meetings.{' '}
        </p>
        <h3>Internship and Post-Doctoral Fellowship</h3>
        <p>
          Dr. Rodr&iacute;guez completed psychoeducational testing and
          psychotherapy with pediatric patients diagnosed with developmental
          disabilities, learning disabilities, and dual diagnostic (comorbid)
          psychological disorders at the Institute for Child and Family Health,
          in Miami, Fla. She then completed a post-doctoral fellowship in
          forensic neuropsychology at a private firm based in Miami, Fla., where
          she worked closely with clients who reported neuropsychological
          injuries as a result of accidents, medical malpractice, and
          negligence. Dr. Rodriguez works closely with lawyers who handle civil
          litigation forensic neuropsychology cases.

        <h3>A Young Man Struck by a Car While Bicycling</h3>
        <p>
          Neuropsychological and psychoeducational evaluation of 19-year-old
          English-language male involved in a civil lawsuit after being struck
          by a car while bicycling. The patient was treated in an emergency room
          for a traumatic brain injury, with loss of consciousness. Dr.
          Rodriguez performed a detailed record review as well as a
          comprehensive neuropsychological and psychoeducational assessment. The
          assessment, in conjunction with records reviewed, yielded a diagnosis
          of a neurocognitive disorder due to traumatic brain injury. Dr.
          Rodriguez determined that the patient also developed depressive and
          anxiety-based symptomatology as a result of the accident. Assessment
          results demonstrated evidence of neuropsychological and psychological
          injuries directly related to the accident.
        </p>
        <h3>A Case of Perinatal Injury</h3>
        <p>
          Neuropsychological evaluation of a 6-year-old bilingual
          (English-Spanish) female involved in a civil lawsuit related to
          injuries suffered during her complicated hospital birth. Her injuries
          resulted in hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (including seizure
          activity) following intrauterine asphyxia, where she suffered from a
          depletion of oxygen to her brain. Global neuropsychological deficits
          were noted in the form of impaired expressive and receptive language
          abilities, deficits in impulse-control and attention, low pre-academic
          achievement, and impaired graphomotor control. Results of
          neuropsychological testing and comprehensive record review yielded
          diagnoses that included neurocognitive disorder due to traumatic brain
          injury and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, combined
          presentation. Assessment results were positively associated with
          evidence of neuropsychological injuries directly related to the
          child's perinatal injury.

        <h3>A Psychological Evaluation for a Defense Insurance Company</h3>
        <p>
          A psychological evaluation was performed for a defense insurance
          company when a 61-year old monolingual Spanish-speaking female sued on
          the basis of experiencing severe depressive symptomatology after
          witnessing her brother's injuries in a car accident. Psychological
          testing, which included the MMPI-2, MCMI-III, as well as symptom
          validity tests revealed that the patient demonstrated a non-credible
          response bias. The psychological testing was helpful to the defense in
          demonstrating malingering.

        <h3>A Fall from a Ride at an Amusement Park</h3>
        <p>
          Psychological evaluation of a 42-year old monolingual
          (English-speaking) male following a slip and fall accident at an
          amusement park that led to disc herniation and cervical spine injuries
          that did not permit him to return to work. The patient sought damages
          as a plaintiff in a civil lawsuit for physical and psychological
          symptoms that included depression, fatigue, insomnia and anxiety. A
          thorough record review and psychological evaluation demonstrated that
          the accident led to a diagnosis of a single episode major depressive
          disorder.
