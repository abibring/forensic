          Meet Dr. Gerald J. Bryant
          <br />
          Forensic Psychologist,
          <br />
          Immigration and Injury Law
        </h3>
        <p>
          Dr. Gerald Bryant provides psychological consultation,
          psychodiagnostic assessments, expert witness reports, and courtroom
          testimony in a wide range of immigration, civil, and criminal cases. A
          clinical and forensic psychologist based in New York City, Dr. Bryant
          has been practicing for more than 20 years. He has served as a
          forensic psychology expert in hundreds of cases, providing expert
          witness evaluations, reports and testimony. He has considerable
          experience in the areas of immigration, personal injury law, and civil
          rights cases. Dr. Bryant performs fitness for duty evaluations, and
          has had extensive training and is a recognized expert in the diagnosis
          and treatment of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.
        </p>
        <h3>Immigration: A Case of Extreme and Exceptional Hardship</h3>
        <p>
          Dr. Bryant has been involved in hundreds of cases where families would
          become separated in the event that one of the family members had to
          leave the United States and return to his or her county of origin. In
          one recent case, the husband of a United States citizen was going to
          be deported back to Bangladesh. The husband was the sole support of
          his family, which included his wife, a United States citizen, and
          their two young sons. When she learned of his pending deportation, the
          wife developed serious and severe clinical depression and anxiety. The
          children, ages seven and five, also became depressed. Their depression
          was exacerbated when they saw how depressed their mother had become
          and how she was no longer the relaxed and loving parent she previously
          had been. Both boys developed psychosomatic symptoms -- chronic
          stomachaches and headaches. They began to manifest the symptoms of a
          separation anxiety disorder; they refused to go to school and
          regressed to the point that they frequently were unable to sleep in
          their own beds and wanted to sleep with their parents. In his
          evaluation, Dr. Bryant found that the depressive symptomatology that
          the mother was exhibiting would become clinically exacerbated if she
          and the children were separated from her husband. Dr. Bryant's expert
          witness report demonstrated that it would represent an extreme and
          exceptional hardship to the wife and children if the man were
          deported.
        </p>
        <h3>Immigration: A Case of Spousal Abuse</h3>
        <p>
          A recent immigration case of spousal abuse involved a young woman,
          born in Colombia, who married a United States citizen. Within a few
          months of their marriage, the woman discovered, to her great alarm and
          dismay, that her husband was a serious alcoholic. In addition, he
          attempted to control her life, to dominate her by isolating her from
          friends and family. He threatened to withdraw his support for the
          change of her immigration status by telling her that she would have to
          do everything that he told her to do. He controlled all access to
          their finances, and if he chose not to give her money, she could not
          even buy food. As the marriage continued, she discovered that not only
          was he abusing alcohol, but was also abusing illegal drugs. As the
          marriage progressed he began to beat her, verbally abuse her, and even
          threatened to kill her. In order to save herself, she had to leave
          him. Dr. Bryant was engaged as an expert psychological witness. His
          psychological evaluation detailed the woman's serious depressive
          symptoms and the fact that she also was suffering from a post
          traumatic stress disorder. The woman was able to remain in the United
          States.
        </p>
        <h3>Immigration: A Case of Political Asylum</h3>
        <p>
          Dr. Bryant has extensive experience in political asylum cases.
          Immigrants are eligible to file a political asylum application if they
          have been tortured, harassed, or discriminated against in another
          country. Discrimination can be on the basis of religious beliefs,
          political affiliations, gender, or sexual orientation. Recently, Dr.
          Bryant wrote an expert witness report in the case of a young man who
          had been persecuted in Guyana because he is a homosexual. The young
          man told Dr. Bryant that in Guyana he was in danger of being sentenced
          to life in prison because, in that country, it is unlawful for two men
          to have a sexual relationship. Dr, Bryant's psychological evaluation
          and expert report were helpful in the judge's decision to grant the
          man political asylum.
        </p>
        <h3>Personal Injury: A Case of Severe Depression and PTSD</h3>
        <p>
          In the area of personal injury law, Dr. Bryant was involved recently
          in the case of a 46-year old woman who was injured while walking on
          the sidewalk in Long Island City. A cellar door was left open and
          unattended in front of a store, and she fell into the cellar. She
          suffered head trauma and severe facial lacerations. The lacerations
          were so serious that she required multiple plastic surgeries. Her
          self-image was so profoundly altered that she exhibited strong
          depressive and anxiety-based symptoms. Her symptoms included severe
          insomnia; loss of appetite; nightmares; phobias about going out of her
          home where she could be observed in public, and repeated, intrusive
          memories or flashbacks of the shock of falling into the cellar. Dr
          Bryant's psychological evaluation established that the woman had
          developed a post traumatic stress disorder which was helpful in her
          personal injury litigation. Dr. Bryant provided follow-up referrals so
          that the patient would access the proper short and long-term care.
        </p>
        <h3>A Case of Violation of Civil Rights</h3>
        <p>
          Dr. Bryant is very familiar with cases involving civil rights
          violations. In one such case he was called on as an expert to provide
          psychological evaluations of two African-American teenage brothers who
          were falsely accused by the police. The brothers, aged 16 and 18, had
          just come home when police officers came to the door, spoke with their
          mother, and demanded that the teens leave their home immediately in
          order to be questioned. No explanation was given as to why the young
          men were needed for questioning and the police dragged the two
          teenagers out of their home. In the ensuing chaos and violence, the
          16-year old boy's nose was broken. It was later discovered that the
          teens were arrested on the suspicion that they had committed an armed
          robbery earlier that day. The boys were held in jail for 48 hours
          without any contact with their family. They were not allowed access to
          an attorney until they were arraigned. Ultimately, it was proven that
          the two boys had nothing whatsoever to do with the robbery. They were
          found totally innocent and released. Dr. Bryant's psychological
          evaluations provided evidence that both young men, especially the
          16-year old, had been psychologically traumatized by the unlawful
          arrests and by being physically dragged out of their home. His report
          was helpful in the presentation of the civil rights case brought
          against the police department and a significant award was made in the
          young men's favor.
        </p>

          University. He received his B.A. degree from City University of New
